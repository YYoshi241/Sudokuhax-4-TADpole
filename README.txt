# Sudokuhax-4-TADpole
Files are already set up for you, just place the files in <DSiWare Dump> (the folder) and rebuild.
These may not be necessary with the latest seedminer release.
This includes the USA and EUR files as well as the JPN 4swordshax files (as of 4/14/18)
THESE FILES ARE ONLY REALLY USUABLE WITH TADpole OFFLINE!!!!!!!!!
if you followed an older seedminer guide, you can use DIS or TADpole online to do this instead if TADpole is difficult to use?
